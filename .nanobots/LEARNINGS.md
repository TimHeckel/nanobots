# Loop Learnings (append-only)

The outer loop's memory. After every completed or failed work item, append an entry.
Newest first. Every ~10 entries, run a **distill pass**: promote durable lessons into
TRIAGE.md, RECIPES.md, or the repo's agent instructions file, then mark the source
entries `[distilled]`. Never delete entries — this file is the audit trail of what the
loop learned and why.

Entry format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <issue #> <short title>
- **Outcome:** merged / reverted / abandoned / escalated
- **What worked / what didn't:** 1-3 bullets
- **Lesson:** the reusable rule, stated so a future triage or build session can apply it
- **Applies to:** triage | build | review | verify | prompt
```

## 2026-08-01 — (seed) Loop bootstrapped
- **Outcome:** n/a
- **Lesson:** This repo's history and docs already encode hard-won knowledge — before
  building in an area, search closed PRs and existing docs instead of rediscovering.
- **Applies to:** build
